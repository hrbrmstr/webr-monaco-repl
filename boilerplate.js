# This pane is Microsoft's Monaco editor that they
# use in VS Code and the online editor in GitHub
#
# Right now I have done a bit of customization to it.
#
# It will syntax highlight R code b/c "duh".
#
# The line the cursor is on will be sent to the 
# "R Console" if you CMD-Enter (or whatev CMD is)
# on your lesser operating systems. I need to make
# this work better but it's better than xterm.js.	
#
# You can also make a multi-line selection and
# "CMD-Enter" to have all that go to the R console
#
# CTRL-l will clear the "R Console"
#
# CMD-shift-i inserts |>
#
# OPTION-shift-MINUS inserts <-
#
# CMD-shift-u brings up a janky WebR environment viewer
#
# CMD-shit-l brings up a janky R history viewer
# 
# It watches for and intercepts '?STRING' and
# will redirect you to a mini-R docs site I setup.
#
# It also intercepts 'browseURL(â€¦)' and will open
# up the parameter in a new tab.
#
# There is a special 'install.runiverse' function
# that will install a single package from R Universe.
# YOU are responsible for dependencies and ensuring
# that all the deps and the pkg itself can run in
# WebR.
#
# Both of those two intercepts are sanitized to 
# protect from (unlikely) XSS attacks.
#
# The "R Console" output pane should auto-scroll for 
# everyone, but I am no HTML "expert".
#
# The upper-right pane is the janky "plot window".
#
# In the command palette is a way to save the
# canvas as a PNG file.
#
# Presently there is no way to load files but you can
# save files.
#
# **BUT** the source pane is saved to local browser
# storage after every source change, so it will 
# reload if you refresh the page. You can use
# CMD-option-s to save the source out.
#
# You can force-clear local storage with CMD-shift-k or 
# open up the Palette (CMD-shift-p) and search for 
# "WebR: Clear Local Storage".
# 
# There is also no way to work interactively in the 
# "R Console", but this is a much nicer "REPL" than
# the example WebR one, but that's just my opinion.
#
# There is no WebR FS browser yet.
#
# Select the cowsay() function, CMD-Enter, then
# cowsay something!
